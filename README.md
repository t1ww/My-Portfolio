# My Portfolio
Narongchai (t3ww)'s Portfolio

# Welcome
This is my personal portfolio website, built using React instead of Vue (which I primarily used in college).

## Why React?
I wanted to explore something new and demonstrate my ability to quickly learn new technologies. This portfolio serves as both a showcase of my skills and a way to experiment with modern web development practices.

## Features (Planned)
- About Me – Introduction & background
- Projects – Showcasing my best work
- Contact – Ways to reach me

## Setup & Installation
(Instructions on how to run your project locally, e.g., npm install && npm run dev)
